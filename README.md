The problem we are working on is described in the file : https://github.com/tanasa/homework.1/blob/master/comments_2_versions_procedural_and_oop.doc

We have developed two solutions:

    Solution 1 (Version 1) is implemented using a procedural approach.
    Solution 2 (Version 2) utilizes an object-oriented approach.

The code of each implementation can be found in the folders : 

version_oop
version_procedural_programming
