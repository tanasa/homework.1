The problem we are working on is described in the file : https://github.com/tanasa/homework.1/blob/master/comments_2_versions_procedural_and_oop.doc
The file also includes notes on the time complexity of the programs.

We have developed two solutions:

    Solution 1 (Version 1) is implemented using a procedural approach.
    Solution 2 (Version 2) utilizes an object-oriented approach.

The code of each implementation can be found in these two folders : 

    version_oop (version_OOP.py)

    version_procedural_programming (version_procedural_programming.py)

An example of a test is shown in the file : https://github.com/tanasa/homework.1/blob/master/example.TR1.transcript.analysis.xls

The input files are : 

    input_transcripts_alignments.txt

    input_transcripts_positions.txt

and the output files are : 

    output_genome_positions.txt

    output_genome_positions_voop.txt
  
Each folder contains also the ipynb and html versions of the python scripts.

The documentation is included with the Python scripts. To execute them, simply type "python" followed by the script names : 

    version_procedural_programming.py   

    version_OOP.py
